BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

~> makepkg -s

   Install missing dependencies using pacman. When build-time or run-time
   dependencies are not found, pacman will try to resolve them. If successful,
   the missing packages will be downloaded and installed. (If the package was
   already built before you may use -sf to overite the previous build)


~> pacman -U <package-name>
  
   Upgrade or add package(s) to the system and install the required 
   dependencies from sync repositories. Enter the path to the build file (.pkg.
   tar.xz) here. This is a “remove-then-add” process. 

Now the build is complete and you can run it using `msm` command in terminal.
